# When accessing this in the code you'll work with it as a dict.
# ENV variables will be replaced with their values. This is done with the envyaml package that is in the code template `load_config`.
# By convention all variables for the project should have the PROJECTNAME_* prefix.
# e.g
# name: ${PROJECTNAME_NAME}
example:
    user_input:
        name: ${PROJECTNAME_USER_INPUT_NAME}
        alternative_name: Lee
